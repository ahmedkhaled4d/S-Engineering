# Shell-Script
The duty of System Administrator is really tough as he/she has to monitor the servers, 
users, logs, create backup and blah blah blah. For the most repetitive task most of the administrator
write a script to automate their day-to-day repetitive task. Here we have written a shell Script that 
do not aims to automate the task of a typical system admin, but it may be helpful at places and specially 
for those newbies who can get most of the information they require about their System, Network, Users, Load, Ram,
host, Internal IP, External IP, Uptime, etc.
