## Overview
essential information that
every serious programmer
needs to know about
algorithms and data structures

<br>

## Design goals

Our original goal was to cover the <em>50 algorithms that every programmer should know</em>.
We use the word <em>programmer</em> to refer to anyone engaged in trying to accomplish
something with the help of a computer, including scientists, engineers, and applications
developers, not to mention college students in science, engineering, and computer science.
The code is optimized for clarity, portability, and efficiency. While some of our 
implementations are as fast as (or faster than) their counterparts in <tt>java.util</tt>,
our main goal is to express the core algorithmic ideas in an elegant and simple manner.
While we embrace some advanced Java features (such as generics and iterators),
we avoid those that interfere with the exposition (such as inheritance and concurrency).

## Build managers

This Folder is intended for use with either the <a href = "https://maven.apache.org">Maven</a>
or <a href = "https://gradle.org">Gradle</a> build managers.
It can be run from either the command line or integrated into
Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ.

## Coursera Algorithms, Part I and II students

Feel free to use this public repository to develop solutions to the programming assignments.
However, please do not store solutions to programming assignments in public repositories.

## Contribute to this repository

This <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/wishlist.txt">wishlist.txt</a>
contains a list of algorithms and data structures that we would
like to add to the repository. Indeed, several of the algorithms and
data structures in this repository were contributed by others. If interested, please
follow the same style as the code in the repository and thoroughly test your
code before contacting us.

## Support for other programming languaages
